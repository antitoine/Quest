## Authentication
You will need to create an App. You can do so by going to following url:
https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps

From there, you can generate an API token.
Oauth is not yet supported.

## Limitations
- The Dropbox API does not return the total number of results. Therefore, it cannot be displayed.
- For some older pages, the images might not load correctly.
